# data_mining_with_song_recognition
 
 ## Project Purpose:
 Create a program that through the use of a user interface does:
 Scrape a band lyrics website. Request the user 2 band names to scrape the lyrics from. Then train a natural language processing (NLP) model for text recognition. And ask the user to write a sentence of a song of either band. Finally predict which band has that on its lyrics.
 
 ### Notes:
 this was my first attempt in web scrapping with beautifulsoup and regex. Also in training a MultinomialNB model. I hope the prompted text and the whole functionality is fun :)
