# data_mining_with_song_recognition
 
 ## Project Purpose:
 Create a program that through the use of an interface can fetch the complete lyrics of 2 bands chosen by a user. Train a machine learning model for language, inform about the accuracy and request the user to test it by writing a sentence. 
 
 Ultimately is a simple demo of web scrapping, machine learning model training and user interaction.
 
 ### Methodology:
a) Used BeautifulSoap for scrapping the web www.lyrics.com <br/>
b) Used scikit-learn to implement a multinomialNB: machine learning algorithm using Naive Bayes. <br/>
c) Scripted in python 3 the user interaction in the console, requesting bands, informing about model, training and testing it with the user input.
 
 ### Notes:
 The data files stored under the data folder are meant to be used in case the HTML format of the target website has changed and the user still wants to run the code.
