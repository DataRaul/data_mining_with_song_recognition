# data_mining_with_song_recognition
 
 ## Project Purpose:
 Create a program that through the use of a user interface:
 Scrapes a band lyrics website. Request the user 2 band names to scrape the lyrics from. Then train a natural language processing (NLP) model for text recognition. And ask the user to write a sentence of a song of either band. Finally predict which band has that on its lyrics.
 
 ### Methodology:
 This was my first attempt in web scrapping with beautifulsoup and regex. Also in training a MultinomialNB model. I hope the console prompted text and the whole functionality is fun :)
 
 The data files stored under the data folder are meant to be used in case the HTML format of the target website has changed and the user still wants to run the code.
