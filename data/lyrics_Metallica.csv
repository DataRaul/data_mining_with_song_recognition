Sound is ripping through your ears The deafening sound of metal nears Your bodies waiting for his whips The taste of leather on your lips Hear the cry of war louder than before With his sword in hand to control the land Crushing metal strikes on this frightening night Fall onto your knees for the phantom lord Victims falling under chains you hear them crying death pains The fists of terrors breaking through now there s nothing you can do Hear the cry of war louder than before With his sword in hand to control the land Crushing metal strikes on this frightening night Fall onto your knees for the phantom lord The leather armies have prevailed the phantom lord has never failed Smoke is lifting from the ground the rising volume metal sound Hear the cry of war louder than before With his sword in hand to control the land Crushing metal strikes on this frightening night Fall onto your knees for the phantom lord Fall to your knees And bow to the phantom lord,Metallica
Guilty as charged But damn it it ain t right There is someone else controlling me Death in the air Strapped in the electric chair This can t be happening to me Who made you God to say I ll take your life from you Flash before my eyes Now it s time to die Burning in my brain I can feel the flames Wait for the sign To flick the switch of death It s the beginning of the end Sweat chilling cold As I watch death unfold Consciousness my only friend My fingers grip with fear What I am doing here? Flash before my eyes Now it s time to die Burning in my brain I can feel the flames Someone help me Oh please God help me They are trying to take it all away I don t want to die Someone help me Oh please God help me They are trying to take it all away I don t want to die Time moving slowly The minutes seem like hours The final curtain call I see How true is this? Just get it over with If this is true just let it be Wakened by the horrid Scream Freed from the frightening dream Flash before my eyes Now it s time to die Burning in my brain I can feel the flames,Metallica

I am Iron Man Come on let s go fuck you up Oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh Has he lost his mind? Can he see or is he blind? Can he walk at all? Or if he moves will he fall? Oh oh oh oh Is he alive or dead? Has he thoughts within his head? We ll just pass him there Why should we even care? Come on you fuckers God bless you all Oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh He was turned to steel In the great magnetic field Where he traveled time For the future of mankind Nobody wants him They just turn their head Nobody helps him Now he waits in regret I wanna hear everybody now come on Oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh Now the time is here For Iron Man to spread fear Vengeance from the grave Kills the people he once saved Nobody wants him They just turn their head Nobody helps him So he waits in regret Alright let s see a fucking wild call Come on Come on Go fucking crazy,Metallica
Finished with my woman cause she couldn t help me with my mind People think I m insane because I am frowning all the time All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy Think I ll lose my mind if I don t find something to pacify Can you help me occupy my brain? Oh yeah let me see you I need someone to show me the things in life that I can t find I can t see the things that make true happiness I must be blind Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry Happiness I cannot feel and love to me is so unreal And so as you hear these words telling you now of my state I tell you to enjoy life I wish I could but it s too late,Metallica
Standin on a corner Suitcase in my hand Jack s in his car says to Jane who s in her vest Me babe I m in a rock n roll band Ridin in a Stutz Bearcat Jim Those were different times And the poets studied rows of verse And all the ladies rolled their eyes Sweet Jane Sweet Jane Sweet Jane Now Jack he is a banker And Jane she is a clerk And the both of them are saving up their money Then they come home from work Sittin by the fire Radio just played a little classical music for you kids The march of the wooden soldiers And you can hear Jack say Sweet Jane Sweet Jane Sweet Jane Some people like to go out dancing And other people like us they gotta work And there s always some evil mothers They ll tell you life is full of dirt And the women never really faint And the villans always blink their eyes And the children are the only ones who blush Cause life is just to die But anyone who has a heart Wouldn t want to turn around and break it And anyone who ever played the part He wouldn t want to turn around and fake it Sweet Jane,Metallica

Guilty as charged But damn it it ain t right There is someone else controlling me Death in the air Strapped in the electric chair This can t be happening to me Who made you God to say I ll take your life from you Flash before my eyes Now it s time to die Burning in my brain I can feel the flames Wait for the sign To flick the switch of death It s the beginning of the end Sweat chilling cold As I watch death unfold Consciousness my only friend My fingers grip with fear What I am doing here? Flash before my eyes Now it s time to die Burning in my brain I can feel the flames Someone help me Oh please God help me They are trying to take it all away I don t want to die Someone help me Oh please God help me They are trying to take it all away I don t want to die Time moving slowly The minutes seem like hours The final curtain call I see How true is this? Just get it over with If this is true just let it be Wakened by the horrid Scream Freed from the frightening dream Flash before my eyes Now it s time to die Burning in my brain I can feel the flames,Metallica

Would you come to me If I was half drowning An arm above the last wave Would you come to me Would you pull me up Would the effort really hurt you Is it unfair to ask you To help pull me up The window broke the silence of the matches The smoke effortlessly floating Pull me up Would you be my lord and savior Pull me up by my hair Now would you kiss me on my lips Burning fever burning on my forehead The brain that once was listening now Shoots out its tiresome message Won t you pull me up Scalding my dead father Has the motor and he s driving towards An island of lost souls Sunny a monkey then to monkey I will teach you meanness fear and blindness No social redeeming kindness Or oh state of grace Would you pull me up Would you drop the mental bullet Would you pull me by the arm up Would you still kiss my lips Hiccup the dream is over Get the coffee turn the lights on Say hello to junior dad The greatest disappointment Age withered him and changed him Into junior dad Psychic savagery The greatest disappointment The greatest disappointment Age withered him and changed him Into junior dad,Metallica
